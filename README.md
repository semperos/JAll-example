# JAll Example #

This project is a simple example of using JAll. There are currently three classes available: `SimpleExample`, `IntermediateExample` and `AdvancedExample`.

You can run the main method of one of these classes as follows:

mvn test -DexampleMainClass=com.semperos.IntermediateExample
```
